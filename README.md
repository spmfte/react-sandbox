- **WebSocket-Enabled Terminal**: Real-time terminal session powered by `xterm.js` and WebSocket.
- **Live Preview**: See output changes instantly as you modify the code.
- **Error Display**: Real-time error feedback for a seamless development experience.
- **File System API**: Explore and fetch files from the server's file system.

## üß© Components

### `Terminal.js`
- Integrates `xterm.js` for terminal emulation.
- Uses WebSocket to connect the terminal to a backend shell.
- Resizes dynamically based on the window dimensions.

### `RunButton.js`
